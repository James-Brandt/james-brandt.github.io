I am a high-achieving electrical and aerospace engineering undergraduate at QUT and a member of QUT's College of Excellence. I have practical experience collaborating with the QUT Motorsport team and the QUT Aerospace Society. I am eager to apply my skills in a team to address real-world engineering challenges.

My main interests are artificial intelligence, space, automation, and robotics. I am also personally interested in the systems powering innovative motorsports competitions such as Formula 1. I seek to blend my aerospace expertise with artificial intelligence and programming to explore my passions and deepen my technical expertise. 

This blog details my personal projects, including programming and research. Predominantly, the aim of these projects are not to expand my coding knowledge, gather data, or to showcase my work. These projects are driven by my deep curiosity for aerospace and a constant motivation to keep pace with the latest innovations, technologies, and breakthroughs.
