I am a high-achieving electrical and aerospace engineering undergraduate at QUT and a member of QUT's College of Excellence. I have practical experience collaborating with the QUT Motorsport team and the QUT Aerospace Society. I am eager to apply my skills in a team to address real-world engineering challenges.

My main interests are artificial intelligence, space, automation, and robotics. I am also personally interested in the systems powering innovative motorsports competitions such as Formula 1. I seek to blend my aerospace expertise with artificial intelligence and programming to explore my passions and deepen my technical expertise. I will use this blog to detail personal projects, including programming and research. These projects will focus on topics that I am passionate about, with the aim to deepen my knowledge of engineering tools as well as my expertise on the topics.
