I am a high-achieving electrical and aerospace engineering undergraduate at QUT (GPA 6.75) with practical experience collaborating with the QUT Motorsport team and the QUT Aerospace Society. My background combines strong analytical skills (proficiency in Python, CAD, and MATLAB) alongside data-driven problem-solving abilities. I also possess demonstrated teamwork and customer service skills gained from frontline hospitality roles. I have been recognised for my academic achievements, having received the Principalâ€™s Honours Award and multiple Academic Excellence Awards during my schooling. Throughout my education, I participated in numerous STEM competitions and was actively involved in social justice and student council committees. I am eager to apply my skills in a team to address real-world engineering challenges.

My main interests are artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics. I am also personally interested in motorsports such as Formula 1. I will use this blog to detail personal projects, including programming and research. These projects will focus on topics that I am passionate about, with the aim to deepen my knowledge of engineering tools as well as my expertise on the topics.
